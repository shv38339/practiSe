## practiSe

This is the **README** file for the repository practiSe.

You may be wondering (or at least my roommate was), why did I spell the word 'practice' with an S. I thought it would force me to take a millisecond in recognizing my code and realize what I was spelling. If I messed up the word 'practice', then that would screw with my commands and I would do them twice. 

Horrible excuse? Maybe. Oh well. 

This is my repo to practice git/GitHub. Wish me luck.

Cheerio,
Steele
